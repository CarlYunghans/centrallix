LEGACY DOCUMENTATION...

    If you've read the History of Centrallix on Centrallix's sourceforge 
    website, you probably know that Centrallix is a three year old project 
    (since 1998).  As a result, it has a fair amount of "legacy" documentation, 
    mostly describing it under its old name, "LightServer".  This documentation 
    is available in the "Legacy" directory of this document tree.  Not all of
    this documentation is current or accurate any more.  As time goes on, I 
    will be rewriting and creating new documentation for this "sysdoc" package,
    but for now much information can be gleaned from the Legacy documentation
    directory.


CURRENT DOCUMENTATION...

    Current documentation is contained in the root of this package, and in
    any subdirectories not labeled "Legacy".
