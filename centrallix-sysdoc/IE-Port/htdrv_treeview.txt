This widget is not totally ported to IE yet. Here is the summary of changes.

-tv_new_layer
This function manages the new layer created in the tree, there are two different cases:
1. Creating a new layer - In DOM1 HTML, to simulate the layer object in NS, we have to
   a. Create a div layer with createElement
   b. set the width
   c. set the position as absolute/relative
   d. append the new nide to the DOM tree
   
   By setting the layer position to relative when we are creating the node, it is possible to set the position of the layers elsewhere later on.
   
2. The nodes are pulled off from cache
   We have to add the node back to the DOM tree in this case

-tv_click   
Note that when handling mouse button in IE, we can't use e.which, but e.button instead

-tv_BuildNewLayers
Probably more changes are required in this function, but one important change that I made is since the new layers are in relatively position, instead of absolute position in NS, we have to move the layer to:
moveTo(one_layer, tgtX + 20, tgtY + 20); 

instead of 

moveTo(one_layer, tgtX + 20, tgtY*i + 20);

-tv_collapse
To delete a layer in the tree, we have to set the innerHTML and outerHTML to nothing.
