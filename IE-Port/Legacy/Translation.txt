I   OVERVIEW

    The translation layer is perhaps one of the more powerful components of 
    the LightServer's architecture, giving a means for automatic object type
    conversion on-the-fly when using the translation layer directly, or the
    capability to store conversion information in a translation object for
    future access without having to supply the sometimes-lengthy parameters
    for complex translations (e.g., generating a database report).
