	<p>Centrallix was conceptualized as early as 1997 during a time when I (Greg) was frustrated with
	a number of web-based environments.  During my off-hours I began considering what it would take
	to create the "ultimate" web application server environment, and the design for the system did
	not come without considerable thought, although the design began to become more clear during mid-1998
	when the system's architecture began to be thought-out.</p>

	<p>As a <a target="_top" href="http://www.LightSys.org">LightSys</a> project, implementation actually began 
	in late 1998 as a framework for a simple report writer for a project
	at Operation Mobilization
	(the same place that <a target="_top" href="http://squirrelmail.org">SquirrelMail</a>
	found its inception), although the system's architecture was designed to encompass far more.  Can
	you believe that the first database driver for Centrallix was a module which did a "telnet" to the
	database server and then ran "isql", parsing its output?  It's true :)  And, it was slow :)</p>

	<p>Originally, Centrallix was known as "LightServer".  We changed the name because there were already
	too many "LightServer" projects on the Internet, and for a few other reasons.  If you look in the
	source code, there are still vestiges of the "LightServer" name here and there, including some reserved
	URI variables such as "ls__params" and "ls__type".</p>

	<p>Centrallix was first demonstrated and used at the <a target="_top" href="http://iccm.org/">ICCM</a> conference 
	at <a target="_top" href="http://www.tayloru.edu/">Taylor University</a> in June of 1999.  Instead of using other
	presentation software for the projected slides, I used... Centrallix itself.... With the slides
	stored in a... Sybase(R) database (11.0.3.3, the free Linux version).</p>

	<p>Since mid-1999, continuing development on the system has been sporadic in nature, and I (Greg) have
	found that the size of the code base has outgrown my ability to effectively develop and maintain all
	on my own.  At about 70,000 lines and 122 files, it has a lot of C code.  Not terribly impressive, but 
	that's over 1000 printed pages.  And, I've decided that without a group of us (&lt;cough&gt; open source &lt;cough&gt;)
	supporting it, it won't be any good to anyone else... or to even myself.</p>

	<p>So, to be honest, I'm really looking forward to what we (as an open source community) can do with
	Centrallix to make it a truly top-notch production-quality app server.  What about you (shameless
	Centrallix developers' plug &lt;grin&gt;)?</p>

	<p>LightSys Technology Services, Inc., is a charitable nonprofit organization.  We are very supportive
	of open-source, free, and standards-based software, since it fits well with the way we do business.
	LightSys provides basically free consulting and IT services to certain other Christian nonprofit organizations,
	and we ourselves are publicly supported (via donations).  We must admit that such is a bit of an unusual
	business model for an IT services firm!</p>

	<p>Because of our business model, we have very little to gain by keeping a piece of software such as 
	Centrallix proprietary in nature.  Even if we kept it proprietary, we wouldn't be selling it for 
	profit.  We believe that the Centrallix system will be beneficial to many people and organizations 
	around the world, and that it can be best developed within the open source community.</p>

	<p>It is our desire to help guide and facilitate this project, but not to over-manage it.  Now that
	it is open-sourced, it is <i>our</i> project as an open-source community, rather than merely a
	LightSys project.</p>
