            <p><b>27-June-2002</b>: Version 0.7.2 has been released. Changed include 
              enhanced controls and a lot of added functionality. Thanks to all 
              the developers who worked so diligently on the system to get it 
              to where it is (even if they still think it isn't mature enough). 
            </p>
            <p><b>19-June-2002</b>: Version 0.7.2 is under way. Centrallix/Kardia 
              has gained a great deal of support since it's introduction and demonstration 
              at the 2002 <a href="http://iccm.org">ICCM</a>, causing a lot of 
              anticipation as development speeds up even more.</p>
            <p><b>17-Oct-2001</b>: Version 0.7.1 released. This version is an 
              interim development release focusing primarily on minor enhancements. 
              We're continuing to press on towards the version 0.8.0 semi-stable 
              release!</p>
            <p><b>07-Aug-2001</b>: The Centrallix source code is now in CVS and 
              is "ready", more or less, for development to begin. We'll be making 
              announcements at various times over the next month in regard to 
              this.</p>
            <p><b>20-Jun-2001</b>: We've finally begun the process of launching 
              Centrallix into the OpenSource arena! The decision to open-source 
              this project came with much discussion and strategic planning, and 
              we're confident that creating free open-source software from this 
              system is the right thing to do. We're <i>very open</i> to any help, 
              suggestions, and even the redesign of components if necessary.</p>

            <p><b>LightSys</b> (<a target="_top" href="http://www.lightsys.org/">www.LightSys.org</a>) 
              has been involved in using and supporting Open Source software for 
              some time, and this system is the largest contribution yet. Previous 
              contributions include an Etherboot 3C905B-TX driver, the LinuxConf 
              Virtual Registry, and a TCP/IP fix for the Linux kernel. LightSys

            <p><b>Taylor University</b> (<a href="http://www.tayloru.edu/" target="_top">http://www.tayloru.edu/</a>) 
              has been involved in providing needed human resources to help work 
              on this project. Taylor University recently created a course dealing 
              with opensource development and chose the Centrallix/Kardia project 
              to work on. Great strides have been made due to the diligent work 
              of those involved from the Taylor University campus.</p>

      <p>Welcome to the website for the Centrallix(tm) application server! Centrallix 
        is a web-based app server and data management engine featuring data abstraction, 
        structural embedding, "pro"-DHTML generation, a SQL engine for multi-source 
        queries, and object-based development. That's the official definition... 
        unofficially, we're attempting to build the ultimate web-based application 
        server in terms of flexibility, structure, extensibility, usability for 
        real-world business applications (as opposed to just websites), and 
	perhaps more....

      <p>Centrallix currently consists of over 100,000 lines of highly modular 
        C code, and depends heavily on JavaScript for the operation of the generated 
        web pages. The system has many working components -- good enough for a small 
        demo that won the ICCM Technology for Missions (TFM contest), but is still lacking 
        in some important areas. The project was conceptualized in 1997 and has 
        been underway off and on since late 1998, with a particularly concentrated 
	development effort since February 2002.
