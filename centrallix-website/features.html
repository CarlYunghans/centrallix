	<p>Centrallix is designed to be a highly-flexible highly-modular app server system.  The name, 
	"Centrallix", pronounced "sen-TRALL-ics", is derived from the idea that the server, when used, would be absolutely central
	to an organization's application and data management, resulting from the capabilities that this
	system provides.  Centrallix is also internally based on fractal principles.  But, why "Fractal" 
	principles? Mathmatically, Centrallix bears no resemblance to Fractal sets. It's an app server, 
	not a collection of points <grin>.... </p>
	
	<p>Instead, Centrallix derives itself from the "self-similarity" attribute of fractals.  Almost all of 
	Centrallix's functionality allows the developer to embed such functionality to the nth degree.  
	Theoretically, it is possible to embed a CSV file inside of any object that supports arbitrary content
	(and supports seeking within that content) and have the Centrallix CSV driver properly interpret and
	handle the CSV data.  In this way, MIME email messages containing files (and other MIME messages), tar
	files containing tar files, and so forth and so on, should be straightforward to support.  Not only so,
	but all of these data sources are simultaneously available to the SQL engine for running queries.</p>

	<p>In a nutshell, what sets Centrallix apart from other app servers is its very high degree of data
	abstraction, structural embedding, and extensibility.</p>

	<p>Oh - and what's that thing about "A.K.A., 'OpenThingy'"?  There are a few of us that have been...
	well... uh... calling the system "OpenThingy".  So I decided to include that in the image at the
	top of these pages ;)</p>

	<p>Here's a summary of Centrallix's major features.  It has others, of course, and will have
	even more as open-source development gets underway, but these are the main features we see and
	forsee for Centrallix:</p>

	<ul><li><b>Data Abstraction:</b> All sources of information are viewed via drivers in Centrallix 
	        as objects in a heirarchy called the "ObjectSystem".  The ObjectSystem Management Layer, or 
		OSML, provides the abstraction layer, giving the other components of Centrallix (such as
		its network connectivity drivers) a consistent and straightforward interface to all types
		of data.  All Centrallix objects have a) an "inner type" or content type of the data the 
		object contains, b) an "outer type" of the object itself, c) possibly content (or void 
		otherwise), d) possibly sub-objects (such as a directory or database table), e) attributes, 
		f) possibly some methods, and g) in the future, events and triggers.  Data of different 
		types are abstracted by modularized ObjectSystem Drivers which interact with the OSML in
		a standard fashion.<br><br>
		</li>
	    <li><b>Structural Embedding:</b> An object's "inner type" (content type) can be such that it is
	        data that another ObjectSystem driver knows how to intelligently handle.  In this case, that
		other driver can "take over" and break the inner content down into more meaningful objects
		(such as when a text file contains a MIME email message or CSV data), which themselves might
		have content which can be further analyzed.  This process is transparent to the user and
		provides some very powerful functionality to the developer.  Furthermore, it encourages code
		re-use since logic which parses a MIME message, for example, doesn't have to be rewritten
		for every different place a MIME message might be found.<br><br>
		</li>
	    <li><b>"Pro" DHTML Generation:</b> It is the design of Centrallix to generate DHTML such that
	        it can be used for real-world business applications instead of just for websites.  In the
		"real" business world, the web-based model fails for many business applications because it
		is simply too clunky or cumbersome for high-performance data entry and other critical
		applications.  Centrallix aims to combat this problem via applications which look and
		feel more like those found in the client-server environment, through the use of extensive
		client-side scripting.  Another drawback to web-based applications is that since web technologies
		are changing at the speed of light, by the time a web-based application is complete some
		18 months after its inception, better technologies have arisen which threaten the web-based
		system.  Centrallix's design is such that the applications themselves can be used in a new
		environment via new document generators within Centrallix rather than rewrites of the 
		applications themselves.  Furthermore, most web-based applications end up being very hard
		to maintain because of their "file pile" organization.  Centrallix aims to solve this problem
		via object-driven rather than script-driven development, in the future utilizing powerful
		dynamic object inheritance facilities to enable reuse and maintainability.<br><br>
		</li>
	    <li><b>Multi-Source Queries:</b>  As mentioned earlier, all data is abstracted into the OSML
	        interface.  Centrallix contains a SQL engine which can combine and transform data from
		one or more of any number of different kinds of data sources.  This provides for powerful
		report-generation capabilities as well as providing a common and easily understood way
		for the various Centrallix components to access data.<br><br>
		</li>
	    <li><b>Object-Based Development:</b> Centrallix, although it can employ scripting facilities,
	        deals with app writing and development through the same object-attribute-subobject model
		that the rest of the ObjectSystem uses.  This makes it straightforward for a graphical
		application designer IDE to be put into use, and allows for powerful dynamic object
		inheritance even for object attribute <i>values</i>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>While Centrallix is not yet complete and thus not all of these benefits are realized
	yet, we are pressing on towards these goals... for your benefit.</p>

	<p>If you are interested in how Centrallix can benefit your organization, this part of this
	page is dedicated to you.  Sometimes we technical developers can get carried away dreaming 
	about what kinds of features we can add to a product like Centrallix.  But if those features
	do not translate into benefits for the people using them, then they are more "fun" than they
	are "useful".</p>

	<p>Summary of Benefits....</p>

	<ul><li><b>Better use of developer time.</b>  Centrallix contains functionality which we hope
	        will make your app developers more effective and efficient at what they do.  This could 
	        translate into lower app development costs and faster development cycles for your 
		organization.<br><br>
	    </li>
	    <li><b>Better information accessibility.</b>  Centrallix's web-based application model means
	        that your corporate information is accessible (within its security model under your
		discretion, of course) in ways that other forms of computing (such as client-server)
		do not provide.  This can allow your staff to access the information they need at more
		locations and with greater ease than ever before, thus making them potentially more
		productive and better able to accomplish your organization's objectives.<br><br>
	    </li>
	    <li><b>Lower deployment costs.</b>  Web-based applications are inherently easier to deploy
	        than other types of applications, since they use a single industry-standard application
		on the user's computer: the browser.  Centrallix brings this model more effectively to the
		business world.  Furthermore, since Centrallix is open-source and free, it has no
		inherent system-wide or per-user licensing fees.  That translates into less financial
		expenditure and fewer administrative headaches keeping track of licensing information.<br><br>
	    </li>
	    <li><b>Improved end-user productivity.</b>  It is our belief that applications with potentially
	        greater visual variety (amidst a consistent user interface) can help improve end-user
		productivity (thus lowering costs and improving throughput).  Centrallix allows you to
		create attractive and creative applications.  Not only so, but its internal structure
		can potentially allow an end-user to customize a pre-built application to his or her
		visual preferences.  These features definitely can improve visual variety, and as we
		believe, thus productivity.<br><br>
	    </li>
	    <li><b>Investment protection.</b>  Technologies these days are changing at a rapid pace,
	        and it is nearly impossible for a business application development team to keep up with
		technology.  Because Centrallix allows your developers to specify <i>what</i> the
		application should look like and <i>what</i> it should do, while at the same time
		taking care of the <i>how</i> question internally via dynamic app generation, you
		are protected against changes in how the <i>how</i> is done.  Though we, the Centrallix
		development team, cannot predict the future nor what impact future changes may have
		on our technologies, we are striving to protect your investment in app development
		time by having Centrallix take care of the <i>how</i> question in many respects.<br><br>
