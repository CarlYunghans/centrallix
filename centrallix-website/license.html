	<p>Most of Centrallix is being released under the <a href=COPYING.html>GNU General Public License</a>.  Because
	we desired some parts of the system to be usable under a lesser license, we have released some components 
	under the <a href=LGPL.html>GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a> and a few components under the 
	<a href=BSD.html>BSD License</a>.  Except for the components described below, the system is GPLed.  Currently,
	the GPLed components include the main "centrallix" package.<p>

	<p>We desire to promote as much compatibility with Centrallix as possible among other software products,
	whether free or proprietary.  Therefore, some of the key libraries and network libraries which support Centrallix
	are being made available under the LGPL.  That way, developers of other proprietary systems can use our LGPLed
	libraries to easily provide connectivity with the Centrallix server.  These libraries are contained wholly in the 
	"centrallix-lib" package which is downloadable from this site.</p>

	<p>Note that the /sys directory in the centrallix-os package, as of release 0.7.2, is now under the LGPL
	license.  We did this so that we could 1) move some of the DHTML javascript functions out of the core
	code base, and 2) thus allow the generated DHTML content itself from Centrallix to be usable under 
	whatever license/copyright the creator of the corresponding .app file chooses.  The javascript files
	would then be a "library" that is linked to via script src= tags.  As of the time of writing of this
	page update, the .js functions were still in the core, however.</p>

	<p>Finally, in order to promote as wide a usage as possible of Centrallix, we are releasing some components
	under the BSD license.  Note that <i>none</i> of the Centrallix codebase is being released under the BSD
	license; only supplemental files and documentation are.  The components that are under the BSD license are 
	as follows:  the /samples directory and its contents in "centrallix-os", a baseline ObjectSystem used to
	start development within the Centrallix environment, "centrallix-doc", the app developer and end-user
	documentation package, and "centrallix-sysdoc", the system developer documentation (for those who code
	the Centrallix system itself).<p>

	<p>As mentioned above, the /sys directory and its contents in centrallix-os is under the LGPL.</p>

	<p>There are a few issues with having different components under differing licenses that developers of
	Centrallix must be aware of.  Before you take a piece of code from a GPLed file and use it in an LGPLed
	file or a BSDed file, you <i>must</i> get permission from the copyright holder for that code.  This
	also applies to using LGPLed code in a BSDed file.<p>
