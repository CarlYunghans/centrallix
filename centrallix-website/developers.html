	<p>So, where do we go from here?  If you're interested in helping to develop the Centrallix
	application server, take a look at this development roadmap and see if there's a place in
	the development effort that would fit your skills and interests well.  Also take a look
	at the <a href="details.html">detailed features list</a> for suggestions.  Furthermore,
	please note that the priorities assigned to the tasks on this page are only approximate...
	if there is a low-priority task (or a task slated for inclusion in a distant future
	version) you want to work on, definitely go for it!</p>

	<p>This list was built at or around version 0.7.0.</p>

	<ul><li><b>For semi-stable prerelease 0.8</b>
	        <ul><li>Completion of some key objectsystem drivers: SMTP, NNTP, POP3, IMAP, 
		        MAILMSG (MIME), QUERY, flat datafile, indexed file.</li>
		    <li>Completion of the new printmgt module (for reporting)</li>
		    <li>Conversion of the htmlgen modules to a themable and browser-sensitive
		        mode of operation, as well as three-stage generation instead of just
			two-stage generation (needed for property sheet generator registry
			later on).</li>
		    <li>Addition of scripting facilities (Javascript engine)</li>
		    <li>Basic completion of the SQL engine (add insert/update/delete operations)</li>
		    <li>Completion of scripting, form elements, and OSML/JS client side integration</li>
		    <li>The use of the pseudo-object-names "*" and "?" to create new auto-primary-key
		        objects and query a list of potential object properties, respectively.</li>
		    <li>Addition of dynamic inheritance in the Centrallix "structure files" that are
		        used, among other things, to define applications, reports, and the like.</li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	    <br>
	    <li><b>For stable release 1.0</b>
	        <ul><li>Addition of new objectsystem drivers: MySQL, PostgreSQL, as well as grouping
		        MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Sybase-CT drivers under a SQL DB meta-objectsystem
			driver to make the writing of further SQL DB drivers far easier.</li>
		    <li>Possible new network interfaces: HTTPS, CORBA, NFS.</li>
		    <li>The ability in the OSML for underlying objects to trigger events asynchronously.</li>
		    <li>Triggers and stored procedures within the OSML</li>
		    <li>SQL extensions for the MQ module: UNION, HAVING, high-level ORDER/GROUP/etc, subqueries</li>
		    <li>Object property sheet generators and property sheet / icon registry</li>
		    <li>The BQDS, Batchable Query Data Service, network protocol for interfacing
		        directly between Centrallix servers (and perhaps more, later on).  This
			is a network interface AND an objectsystem driver.</li>
		    <li>An objectsystem driver for XML.</li>
		    <li>Completion of "proper" transaction support for the OSML.</li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	    <br>
	    <li><b>For stable release 1.2</b>
	        <ul><li>Replication support within the OSML</li>
		    <li>A GUI graphical design IDE for development of Centrallix applications, reports,
		        and so forth.</li>
		    <li>Connectivity via JDBC, ODBC, and other means (use BQDS?).</li>
		    <li>Dynamic module loading and configuration</li>
		</ul>
	    </li
	    <br>
	</ul>

	<p>This section is designed to acquaint you with getting started in the development of
	Centrallix components, objectsystem drivers, and the like.</p>
	
	<p>First, drop me (<a href="mailto:Greg.Beeley@LightSys.org">Greg</a>), or another 
	project manager, an email describing what you'd like to do in Centrallix.  Then,
	be sure you have retrieved all five Centrallix packages from CVS (core, sysdoc, doc,
	lib, and os) and make sure you have Centrallix basically operational on your system.
	If you've never developed Centrallix before, you'll probably want to work with an
	anonymously checked-out copy of the source for a while to get used to things before
	you get developer (read/write) access to CVS from us.  But, if you are going to be a
	long-term Centrallix core developer, please let us know.</p>

	<p>If you need help learning CVS, see the good documentation that SourceForge has
	on this topic.  Also, there is a very good CVS online book available (the full
	book is also available in stores).</p>

	<p>Next, make sure you are subscribed to one or more of the mailing lists, particularly
	centrallix-devel.  Once your new module is in the source code tree and is in wide
	use, you will want to subscribe to centrallix-users in order to help people who may
	have questions about your module.  The centrallix-announce list is also a good one
	to be on.</p>

	<p>Be sure to read some of the key documentation files.  For all development, read the
	CodingStandards.txt file in the sysdoc package as well as the Terminology.txt file
	in that same package.  If you want to use the same coding style as most of the rest
	of the core, read BeeleyCodingStyle.txt as well.  If you are writing a new 
	objectsystem driver, read the OSDriver_Authoring.txt file and refer to the OBJDRV_PROTOTYPE.c
	stub driver file.</p>

	<p>All modules have a two-to-five letter prefix which makes that module unique among
	the available modules.  If you are writing a new module (os driver, etc.), you will want to chose a
	unique prefix for it.  See the Prefixes.txt file in the sysdoc package for a list of current
	prefixes that are in use.  You may also want to grep through the source files looking for
	"^prefixInitialize" to see if someone forgot to add their prefix to Prefixes.txt.  While you're
	at it, be sure to add your prefix to Prefixes.txt ;) and CVS commit Prefixes.txt (or if you don't
	have read/write access to CVS yet, send your prefix to me in an email).</p>

	<p>While developing, make sure you compile Centrallix and its libraries with debugging
	enabled (-g in CFLAGS).  Also, you may find the test_obj program useful for interactive
	testing of the OSML at the command line.</p>

	<font size="+2">Centrallix Conventions / Standards....</font>
	<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td background="gradient02.png"><img border="0" height="2" width="1" src="gradient02.png"></td></tr></table>

	<p>The following is a list of a few conventions and standards that have been put in place,
	mostly to address logistical development issues ;)</p>

	<ul><li><b>Coding Style and Standards.</b>  The Centrallix core has an established standard
	        coding style, although you don't <i>have</i> to follow that style if you're creating a new
		file, whether in the core or not.  It's only important to follow the established
		style when working on an existing module written in that style.</li><br>
	    <li><b>CVS Access.</b>  Our CVS repository is hosted at SourceForge.  Anyone may retrieve 
	        copies of the Centrallix system via anonymous CVS.  Only project developers may
		gain read/write access to CVS.</li><br>
	    <li><b>Releases.</b>  The project uses a fairly standard release/version numbering
	        system.  Release numbers are of the form AA.BB.CC, where AA is the major release
		number, BB the minor release number, and CC the patchlevel.  The BB number is
		important to pay attention to, since if it is <i>odd</i>, the release is 
		a <i>development</i> version and should not be considered stable.  If the BB
		number is <i>even</i>, the version is considered <i>stable</i>.  For instance,
		the current (as of 13-Aug-2001) 0.7.0 version is <i>unstable</i>.</li><br>
	    <li><b>CVS Branches.</b>  When we're ready to release a stable version of Centrallix,
	        we will create a CVS branch for that stable version, and the development
		versions will continue on the trunk.  CVS tags will either be of the form
		DEVELOPMENT-AA-BB-CC or STABLE-AA-BB-CC, using the version numbering approach
		outlined above.</li><br>
	    <li><b>RPM Versions.</b>  We will probably only make RPM versions available of 
	        stable releases, although perhaps that might change.  Development releases may
		be obtained either via CVS or via .tgz downloads.  Beta releases may be made
		available in RPM format.</li><br>
	</ul>
