This test suite uses test_obj to run SQL queries or other test_obj commands
and compares the output against "correct" output.  The test suite detects
crashes and failures.

Use "make test" to run the test suite.

Each test suite item should have three files:

    tests/test_{category}_NN.to   -   test_obj command script
    tests/test_{category}_NN.cmp  -   "correct" output
    tests/test_{category}_NN.desc -   description of the test, up to 40chars

The *.cmp file can be derived from the *.out file that is generated by
running the test suite the first time.  Be sure the *.out file is correct!!

The test_baseline_NN tests only validate that the test suite itself is
operating correctly.

Todo:  add a lockup detector - an alarm() and signal(SIGALRM,...) call in
test_obj with a new test_obj cmd line parameter to indicate how many seconds
to wait before exiting on alarm().
