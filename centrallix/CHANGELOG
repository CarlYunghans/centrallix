	    retrieval of an entire subtree of objects with one select
	    statement.
	7.  Added templating mechanism for applications to allow the
	    application of a "style" to an application, and reducing a lot of

	    terminology dependence on the DHTML/HTTP app delivery mechanism.
	9.  Added a working dropdown/popup menu widget, complete with 
	    separators, submenus, and main menubars.
	10. Added an inter-widget interface mechanism to standardize the way
	    widgets interact.
	11. Fixed a few memory leaks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.3 --> 0.7.4	    01-Mar-2005     MAJOR DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

    Once again, this is a major development release - including a lot of new
    features and a lot of bug fixes.

    Changes:

	1.  Moderate Mozilla 1.x support and IE6 support now implemented, as
	    well as some user agent detection logic, capabilities matrix, and
	    browser compatibility layer.
	2.  Image widget added.
	3.  Obscure/Reveal subsystem for automatically managing the issue of
	    window or tab closure while data is unsaved, etc.
	4.  Serialization of loading of data from server to browser provides
	    a great deal more robustness.
	5.  V3 prtmgmt subsystem is now operational.
	6.  Report writer revamped; support for far more complex report outputs
	    including graphics, borders, etc.  
	    NOTE: incompatible changes made in report spec format ( .rpt file).
	7.  Matt McGill added a POP3 driver.
	8.  New scrollbar widget.
	9.  Widgets such as datetime, dropdown, checkbox, etc., can all receive
	    keyboard focus and participate in the tabbing order.
	10. Time-setting controls added to datetime widget
	11. Datetime, dropdown, and checkbox now allow NULL values.
	12. Presentation hints:  delivery to client working; some support for
	    certain hints on the client (such as allowchars/badchars, defaults,
	    etc.).  Also added 'alwaysdef' style hint for resetting the default
	    value on all modifications.  Better support for presentation hints
	    in sybase driver.
	13. objInfo() mechanism for obtaining metadata about an object.
	14. "widget tree" module added (MJM) - allows for three-step generation
	    process for apps, which allows composite widgets and in the near
	    future, component widgets.  Delivery of the entire structural
	    widget tree to the client is now supported.
	15. "widget/formbar" widget added to demonstrate the composite widget
	    approach (basically a hardcoded component of sorts).
	16. "interface" module added to support interfaces to components and
	    proper versioning on those interfaces.  Delivery of interface data
	    to the client is supported.
	17. Efficiency enhancements to the osrc (objectsource) widget.
	18. NOTE: incompatible change made to widget/table "column" object - 
	    the field name is now determined from the 'fieldname' attribute
	    rather than from the column object's name.
	19. NOTE: enforcement of unique namespace for widgets is now performed,
	    so apps that reused names for things like connectors will have to
	    be modified before use with 0.7.4.
	20. Moved Centrallix-lib include files into their own directory instead
	    of in the main /usr/include directory.
	21. Unindexed and readonly DBL ISAM files ObjectSystem driver.
	22. PDF/PostScript output from the report writer.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.2 --> 0.7.3	    19-Jun-2003	    MAJOR DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

    This is a major development release.  As before, we've added a lot of
    features and fixed a number of bugs.

    Changes:

	1.  XML objectsystem driver added to parse XML data and allow SQL
	    queries on that data.
	2.  Fleshed out events and actions on many of the widgets and cleaned
	    up the DHTML widget modules a bit.
	3.  Separated the javascript functions out into include files which
	    are referenced in the generated pages as needed.
	4.  GZip content encoding now supported to reduce bandwidth needed to
	    load the generated pages, depending on browser support.
	5.  Several new widgets added: Calendar (date/time), Text Area
	6.  MIME/rfc822 objectsystem driver added to parse rfc822 messages
	    with MIME encoding and to allow SQL queries on that data..  The 
	    MIME driver can also be used apart from rfc822 messages.
	7.  objInfo() OSML API method added to obtain some 'structural'
	    metainfo about an object.
	8.  NFS netdriver added so that Centrallix can act as an NFS server.
	9.  Added "xringqueue" ringbuffer based queue module to centrallix-lib.
	10. Added "cxsec" optional security hardening module to centrallix-lib.
	11. Work begun on "presentation hints" data presentation rules and
	    display hints mechanism.
	12. Gzip objectsystem driver for transparent handling of .gz encoded
	    data.
	13. Mailbox (mbox) objectsystem driver for handling an entire mailbox
	    of email messages (message/rfc822).
	14. Shell objectsystem driver for access to operating system shell
	    commands.  Warning - can be very insecure and is disabled by
	    default in the build.
	15. Centrallix shutdown handler mechanism allows for clean shutdown
	    when receiving SIGINT (ctrl-c).
	16. Added maintained client-side expressions to the htmlgen subsystem,
	    currently only active on 'enabled' properties on buttons.
	17. V3 prtmgmt subsystem is nearing completion.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.1 --> 0.7.2	    20-Jun-2002	    MAJOR DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

    This is a major development release.  We've added a lot of features and
    fixed a number of bugs.

    Changes:

	1.  In process of adding support for scripts in structure files.  This
	    will allow embedding of functions and more advanced facilities 
	    within apps and potentially reports.
	2.  Added support for a global configuration file, centrallix.conf, 
	    that can be used to customize the server name, logging mechanism,
	    and HTTP module TCP listener port.  The -c command line option can
	    point to the configuration file if not at the default location
	    (/usr/local/etc/centrallix.conf).  A sample centrallix.conf can be
	    found in the centrallix-os package in the doc/install directory.
	3.  Better support for running Centrallix as a non-root user via the
	    availability of alternate-password-file authentication.  Note that
	    Centrallix's security model is not mature enough yet to make
	    running as non-root a serious option, though we're working on it.
	4.  Fixed a few potential security problems in the htmlgen subsystem's
	    various modules, primarily including sprintf() vs. snprintf()
	    function calls.
	5.  Added some preliminary work towards the version-3 prtmgmt sub-
	    system.  These files are the "v3" files in the 'report' directory.
	6.  Major additions to the html generation subsystem including the
	    form and object source widgets which allow communication with the
	    Centrallix server from the client.  Many widgets have been created
	    and/or updated in this release, including the form widget, form
	    status widget, editbox, objectsource, spinner box, dropdown list,
	    dynamic mode table, label, DOM-viewer treeview mode for debugging,
	    as well as various improvements in other widgets.
	7.  A number of security and bug fixes of a variety of sorts.
	8.  Added varargs (_va) functions to htmlgen, so that writing htdrivers
	    is now much cleaner, avoiding buffer overruns and/or string 
	    truncation via an API change.
	9.  HTML client objectsystem driver created, mainly for use in "web
	    services", or accessing data remotely over the network via HTTP.
	10. Modified net_http to include watchdog timer support to auto-timeout
	    a user's session after a configurable amount of time.  Default
	    closes a session after 3 minutes of no access, or 30 minutes of no
	    actual end-user activity.
	11. Autoconf support added.  Run the configure script to enable/disable
	    the http client and sybase client objectsystem drivers.
	12. Loadable module support added.  Various modules, including htmlgen
	    drivers, objdrivers, and netdrivers, can all be loaded as shared
	    object (.so) modules now, if configured as such.
	13. Initial multi-browser support infrastructure added.  No widgets,
	    however, currently support anything other than NS4.7x.
	14. Widget documentation is now in an XML file.  Scripts are included
	    to transform that into the HTML version of the document.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.0 --> 0.7.1	    17-Oct-2001	    INTERIM DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

    This is an interim development release.  We've added a few internal 
    architectural features and fixed some bugs.

    Changes:

	1.  Expressions in structure files support.  Structure files, if they
	    start with the magic key "$Version=2$", and have semicolons after
	    attribute values, can now have expressions as attribute values.
	    This also has helped improve the memory efficiency of structure 
	    files.  This also involved moving the stparse module into the core
	    from the lib.
	2.  Fixed the fdRead()/objRead() incompatibility involving the 
	    differing order of the 'flags' and 'offset' arguments.  The 
	    objRead() function is the one that was changed.  This also caused
	    the OSML lower API to change as well so that objdriver methods
	    now use the correct ordering in their Read() and Write() functions.
	3.  Luke added windowshading support to the htdrv_window module.  Just
	    double-click the titlebar and the window rolls up or down.
	4.  The XString module in centrallix-lib now has three new XString 
	    methods: xsPrintf(), xsConcatPrintf(), and xsWrite.  The first two
	    are sprintf() like functions that handle '%s' and '%d'.  The last
	    new function works like fdWrite or objWrite, and can be passed to
	    functions that expect a fdWrite/objWrite type of callback function.
	5.  The Expression module now has expGenerateText() which can convert
	    an expression tree back to its text form.  This was used to help
	    enable the expressions-in-structure-files support listed above.
	6.  Matt added GNU Readline support to test_obj.  Some of you may 
	    need to add -lncurses or -lcurses to the LIBS entry in the 
	    Makefile.  Autoconf support isn't complete yet.
	7.  The .build file causing commit/update conflicts should not be a
	    problem anymore - there is a new .build/.subbuild system which
	    keeps the master .build id's (on Greg's system) separate from
	    .subbuild id's that others can use.
	8.  Minor efficiency enhancement to the expression compiler and
	    evaluator.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
