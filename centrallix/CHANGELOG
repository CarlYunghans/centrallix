Centrallix ChangeLog
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.2 --> 0.7.3	    Not Yet Released

    Changes:

	1.  XML objectsystem driver added to parse XML data and allow SQL
	    queries on that data.
	2.  Fleshed out events and actions on many of the widgets and cleaned
	    up the DHTML widget modules a bit.
	3.  Separated the javascript functions out into include files which
	    are referenced in the generated pages as needed.
	4.  GZip content encoding now supported to reduce bandwidth needed to
	    load the generated pages, depending on browser support.
	5.  Several new widgets added: Calendar (date/time), Text Area
	6.  MIME/rfc822 objectsystem driver added to parse rfc822 messages
	    with MIME encoding and to allow SQL queries on that data..  The 
	    MIME driver can also be used apart from rfc822 messages.

0.7.1 --> 0.7.2	    20-Jun-2002	    MAJOR DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

    This is a major development release.  We've added a lot of features and
    fixed a number of bugs.

    Changes:

	1.  In process of adding support for scripts in structure files.  This
	    will allow embedding of functions and more advanced facilities 
	    within apps and potentially reports.
	2.  Added support for a global configuration file, centrallix.conf, 
	    that can be used to customize the server name, logging mechanism,
	    and HTTP module TCP listener port.  The -c command line option can
	    point to the configuration file if not at the default location
	    (/usr/local/etc/centrallix.conf).  A sample centrallix.conf can be
	    found in the centrallix-os package in the doc/install directory.
	3.  Better support for running Centrallix as a non-root user via the
	    availability of alternate-password-file authentication.  Note that
	    Centrallix's security model is not mature enough yet to make
	    running as non-root a serious option, though we're working on it.
	4.  Fixed a few potential security problems in the htmlgen subsystem's
	    various modules, primarily including sprintf() vs. snprintf()
	    function calls.
	5.  Added some preliminary work towards the version-3 prtmgmt sub-
	    system.  These files are the "v3" files in the 'report' directory.
	6.  Major additions to the html generation subsystem including the
	    form and object source widgets which allow communication with the
	    Centrallix server from the client.  Many widgets have been created
	    and/or updated in this release, including the form widget, form
	    status widget, editbox, objectsource, spinner box, dropdown list,
	    dynamic mode table, label, DOM-viewer treeview mode for debugging,
	    as well as various improvements in other widgets.
	7.  A number of security and bug fixes of a variety of sorts.
	8.  Added varargs (_va) functions to htmlgen, so that writing htdrivers
	    is now much cleaner, avoiding buffer overruns and/or string 
	    truncation via an API change.
	9.  HTML client objectsystem driver created, mainly for use in "web
	    services", or accessing data remotely over the network via HTTP.
	10. Modified net_http to include watchdog timer support to auto-timeout
	    a user's session after a configurable amount of time.  Default
	    closes a session after 3 minutes of no access, or 30 minutes of no
	    actual end-user activity.
	11. Autoconf support added.  Run the configure script to enable/disable
	    the http client and sybase client objectsystem drivers.
	12. Loadable module support added.  Various modules, including htmlgen
	    drivers, objdrivers, and netdrivers, can all be loaded as shared
	    object (.so) modules now, if configured as such.
	13. Initial multi-browser support infrastructure added.  No widgets,
	    however, currently support anything other than NS4.7x.
	14. Widget documentation is now in an XML file.  Scripts are included
	    to transform that into the HTML version of the document.

0.7.0 --> 0.7.1	    17-Oct-2001	    INTERIM DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

    This is an interim development release.  We've added a few internal 
    architectural features and fixed some bugs.

    Changes:

	1.  Expressions in structure files support.  Structure files, if they
	    start with the magic key "$Version=2$", and have semicolons after
	    attribute values, can now have expressions as attribute values.
	    This also has helped improve the memory efficiency of structure 
	    files.  This also involved moving the stparse module into the core
	    from the lib.
	2.  Fixed the fdRead()/objRead() incompatibility involving the 
	    differing order of the 'flags' and 'offset' arguments.  The 
	    objRead() function is the one that was changed.  This also caused
	    the OSML lower API to change as well so that objdriver methods
	    now use the correct ordering in their Read() and Write() functions.
	3.  Luke added windowshading support to the htdrv_window module.  Just
	    double-click the titlebar and the window rolls up or down.
	4.  The XString module in centrallix-lib now has three new XString 
	    methods: xsPrintf(), xsConcatPrintf(), and xsWrite.  The first two
	    are sprintf() like functions that handle '%s' and '%d'.  The last
	    new function works like fdWrite or objWrite, and can be passed to
	    functions that expect a fdWrite/objWrite type of callback function.
	5.  The Expression module now has expGenerateText() which can convert
	    an expression tree back to its text form.  This was used to help
	    enable the expressions-in-structure-files support listed above.
	6.  Matt added GNU Readline support to test_obj.  Some of you may 
	    need to add -lncurses or -lcurses to the LIBS entry in the 
	    Makefile.  Autoconf support isn't complete yet.
	7.  The .build file causing commit/update conflicts should not be a
	    problem anymore - there is a new .build/.subbuild system which
	    keeps the master .build id's (on Greg's system) separate from
	    .subbuild id's that others can use.
	8.  Minor efficiency enhancement to the expression compiler and
	    evaluator.
