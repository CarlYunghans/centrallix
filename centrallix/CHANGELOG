Centrallix ChangeLog
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.1 --> 0.7.2	    ** not yet released **

    Changes:

	1.  In process of adding support for scripts in structure files.  This
	    will allow embedding of functions and more advanced facilities 
	    within apps and potentially reports.
	2.  Added support for a global configuration file, centrallix.conf, 
	    that can be used to customize the server name, logging mechanism,
	    and HTTP module TCP listener port.  The -c command line option can
	    point to the configuration file if not at the default location
	    (/usr/local/etc/centrallix.conf).  A sample centrallix.conf can be
	    found in the centrallix-os package in the doc/install directory.
	3.  Better support for running Centrallix as a non-root user via the
	    availability of alternate-password-file authentication.  Note that
	    Centrallix's security model is not mature enough yet to make
	    running as non-root a serious option, though we're working on it.
	4.  Fixed a few potential security problems in the htmlgen subsystem's
	    various modules, primarily including sprintf() vs. snprintf()
	    function calls.
	5.  Added some preliminary work towards the version-3 prtmgmt sub-
	    system.  These files are the "v3" files in the 'report' directory.
	6.  Major additions to the html generation subsystem including the
	    form and object source widgets which allow communication with the
	    Centrallix server from the client.  Many other widgets have been
	    created and/or updated in this release, too many to name here.

0.7.0 --> 0.7.1	    17-Oct-2001	    INTERIM DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

    This is an interim development release.  We've added a few internal 
    architectural features and fixed some bugs.

    Changes:

	1.  Expressions in structure files support.  Structure files, if they
	    start with the magic key "$Version=2$", and have semicolons after
	    attribute values, can now have expressions as attribute values.
	    This also has helped improve the memory efficiency of structure 
	    files.  This also involved moving the stparse module into the core
	    from the lib.
	2.  Fixed the fdRead()/objRead() incompatibility involving the 
	    differing order of the 'flags' and 'offset' arguments.  The 
	    objRead() function is the one that was changed.  This also caused
	    the OSML lower API to change as well so that objdriver methods
	    now use the correct ordering in their Read() and Write() functions.
	3.  Luke added windowshading support to the htdrv_window module.  Just
	    double-click the titlebar and the window rolls up or down.
	4.  The XString module in centrallix-lib now has three new XString 
	    methods: xsPrintf(), xsConcatPrintf(), and xsWrite.  The first two
	    are sprintf() like functions that handle '%s' and '%d'.  The last
	    new function works like fdWrite or objWrite, and can be passed to
	    functions that expect a fdWrite/objWrite type of callback function.
	5.  The Expression module now has expGenerateText() which can convert
	    an expression tree back to its text form.  This was used to help
	    enable the expressions-in-structure-files support listed above.
	6.  Matt added GNU Readline support to test_obj.  Some of you may 
	    need to add -lncurses or -lcurses to the LIBS entry in the 
	    Makefile.  Autoconf support isn't complete yet.
	7.  The .build file causing commit/update conflicts should not be a
	    problem anymore - there is a new .build/.subbuild system which
	    keeps the master .build id's (on Greg's system) separate from
	    .subbuild id's that others can use.
	8.  Minor efficiency enhancement to the expression compiler and
	    evaluator.
