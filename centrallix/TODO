Centrallix To-Do List	0.9.0	25-Mar-2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of these items do have some existing design in place, though not all of
the design documents may be in CVS at present.  If you'd like to work on one of
these (woohoo!), please email the mailing list :)

- MySQL Database Driver.  We'd like to take the current Sybase objectsystem
  driver and create from it a generic SQL database access objectsystem driver,
  with db-specific modules, the first of which would be the existing Sybase
  driver; this would be the easiest way to add MySQL support.

- Data/Domain Logic Object (DLO) objectsystem driver.  Providing business logic
  encapsulation of existing data sources.

- RBAC Security subsystem (CXSS).  Centrallix is flexible enough that without a
  strong policy-driven security model, it can be quite insecure.

- Application of themes to the HTML generator.  We need a way to theme the
  output of htmlgen without impacting functionality should the theme be non-
  existent.  In other words, this is entirely a visual / artistic endeavor, not
  a functionality issue.  But it is important.

- Full functionality in Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera.  Right now only
  Mozilla/Firefox is supported (Netscape 4.x works but is deprecated).  Part of
  the system already works in IE, but full functionality will be needed.

- Application Management Layer (AML).  Part of this functionality exists at
  present in the HTTP network driver.  We need to formalize the AML however.
  In the four layer architecture model, this comprises much of the Application
  Model Layer.

- Stateful Process Modeler (SPM).  Provides declarative procedural processing
  for Centrallix.

- Layered Applications and OSML inheritance.
