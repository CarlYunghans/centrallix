Centrallix Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.0, 25-Mar-2008

This is a major development release of Centrallix.  See the release notes for
the previous versions for further details.

1.  Be sure to download at least centrallix, centrallix-lib, and centrallix-os.
    Without those three packages, things will not work.

2.  This version should not be considered secure enough to run on a computer
    that can be accessed by a non-trusted network (internet, etc.).  Please
    firewall your running Centrallix binary from such networks.

3.  "makedepend" is REQUIRED for the build to work.  You can get it by 
    installing your XFree86-devel or Xorg-devel package if you haven't already.

4.  To be able to use 'altpasswd' authentication, you need to have a working
    htpasswd command on your system - it comes with the httpd or apache
    package.

5.  See the online documentation http://www.centrallix.net/docs/docs.php for
    instructions on building and installing from source.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7.5, (unreleased)

This is a major development release of Centrallix.  See the release notes for
the previous versions for further details.

1.  Be sure to download at least centrallix, centrallix-lib, and centrallix-os.
    Without those three packages, things will not work.

2.  This version should not be considered secure enough to run on a computer
    that can be accessed by a non-trusted network (internet, etc.).  Please
    firewall your running Centrallix binary from such networks.

3.  "makedepend" is REQUIRED for the build to work.  You can get it by 
    installing your XFree86-devel or Xorg-devel package if you haven't already.

4.  To be able to use 'altpasswd' authentication, you need to have a working
    htpasswd command on your system - it comes with the httpd or apache
    package.

5.  If you intend to use Centrallix with Sybase ASE, install your Sybase ASE
    packages first (including the OCSD).  On newer systems, Sybase ASE 11.0.3
    does not grok locales like "en_US.utf8".  Change it to just "en_US" and you
    will be fine.

6.  See the 0.7.4 release notes for an example of how to install as a non-
    root user, and the 0.7.3 release notes for an example of how to install
    the package as root.  If you are root and installing RPM's, this does
    not apply, of course!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7.4, 01-Mar-2005

This is a major development release of Centrallix.  See the release notes for
the previous versions for further details.

1.  Be sure to download at least centrallix, centrallix-lib, and centrallix-os.
    Without those three packages, things will not work.

2.  This version should not be considered secure enough to run on a computer
    that can be accessed by a non-trusted network (internet, etc.).  Please
    firewall your running Centrallix binary from such networks.

3.  We have some support for Mozilla and IE6 now; however it is not complete.
    Your mileage may vary.... but Netscape 4.80 does work.

4.  "makedepend" is REQUIRED for the build to work.  You can get it by 
    installing your XFree86-devel or Xorg-devel package if you haven't already.

5.  To be able to use 'altpasswd' authentication, you need to have a working
    htpasswd command on your system - it comes with the httpd or apache
    package.

6.  Some incompatible changes were made since 0.7.3.  In particular, there is
    now a 'fieldname' attribute on table-column widgets, the report writer
    spec has changed significantly, and enforcement of unique widget names
    in a .app file is now performed.

7.  If you intend to use Centrallix with Sybase ASE, install your Sybase ASE
    packages first (including the OCSD).  On newer systems, Sybase ASE 11.0.3
    does not grok locales like "en_US.utf8".  Change it to just "en_US" and you
    will be fine.

8.  See the 0.7.3 release notes for some brief installation instructions when
    building and installing as "root".  To install as a "normal user" in your
    own home directory:

	$ cd ~
	$ mkdir centrallix
	$ mkdir cxinst
	$ cd centrallix
	$ tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-0.7.4.tgz
	$ tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-lib-0.7.4.tgz
	$ tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-os-0.7.4.tgz
	$ tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-doc-0.7.4.tgz
	$ tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-sysdoc-0.7.4.tgz
	$ cd centrallix-lib
	$ ./configure --prefix=~/cxinst
	$ make install
	$ cd ../centrallix
	$ ./configure --prefix=~/cxinst
	$ make install
	$ make modules_install
	$ make config
	$ vi ~/cxinst/etc/centrallix.conf
	    (change the port to something non-privileged, like 8800)
	    (switch to altpasswd auth and set altpasswd file)
	$ htpasswd -c ~/etc/centrallix/cxpasswd yourusername
	    (enter a password to access centrallix with)
	    (only use the -c flag the first time you do this)
	$ vi ~/cxinst/etc/centrallix/rootnode
	    (change the path to /home/yourusername/centrallix/centrallix-os)
	$ vi ~/.bashrc
	    (add ~/cxinst/sbin to $PATH, ~/cxinst/lib to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
	$ . ~/.bashrc
	$ centrallix
	    (now point your browser to http://localhost:8800/samples/ors.app
	     or some similar test application).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7.3, 19-Jun-2003 

This is a major development release of Centrallix.  See the release notes for
the previous versions for further details.

1.  Be sure to download at least centrallix, centrallix-lib, and centrallix-os.
    Without those three packages, things will not work.

2.  This version should not be considered secure enough to run on a computer
    that can be accessed by a non-trusted network (internet, etc.).  Please
    firewall your running Centrallix binary from such networks.

3.  The NFS server netdriver is still very unstable, and very insecure.  It
    is disabled per default.  Don't use it unless you know what you're doing!

4.  The SHL osdriver should be considered insecure.  Don't enable it unless
    you know what you are doing.

5.  Be sure to edit your rootnode and point the path to the directory for the
    centrallix-os package!

6.  Basic build and install (if root; it is often better to build/run as non-
    root, if so the procedure differs slightly and your configuration will 
    use a different HTTP port and altpasswd auth instead of system auth):

    # cd /usr/local
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-0.7.3.tgz
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-lib-0.7.3.tgz
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-os-0.7.3.tgz
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-doc-0.7.3.tgz
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-sysdoc-0.7.3.tgz
    # cd centrallix-lib
    # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    # make install
    # cd ../centrallix
    # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    # make install
    # make modules_install
    # make config
    # vi /usr/local/etc/centrallix.conf
    # vi /usr/local/etc/rootnode
    # centrallix


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7.2, 20-Jun-2002 

This is an interim development release of Centrallix.  See the release notes
below for 0.7.1 and 0.7.0; generally they still apply.  A few notes and
clarifications though.

1.  Be sure to download AT LEAST the centrallix, centrallix-lib, and
    centrallix-os packages.  The system will be nonfunctional without at least
    those three packages.

2.  Autoconf detects many of the settings that had to be configured manuallly
    previously including Sybase support and the different versions of 
    Readline.

3.  This version should not be considered secure enough to run on a computer
    that can be accessed by a non-trusted network (i.e. the Internet).  It
    has not undergone a security audit yet.  Before running Centrallix, please
    be sure that your computer cannot be accessed by untrusted networks.

4.  There are detailed installation instructions for each of the required
    Centrallix packages (centrallix, centrallix-lib, and centrallix-os).  They
    can be found in the base directory for their respective packages in a file
    called INSTALL.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7.1, 17-Oct-2001

This is an interim development release of Centrallix.  See the release notes 
below for 0.7.0; generally they still apply.  A few new notes and clarifications,
though:

1.  Be sure to download AT LEAST the centrallix, centrallix-lib, and 
    centrallix-os packages.  The system will be nonfunctional without at least
    those three packages.

2.  Be sure to make sure that you update both centrallix-lib and centrallix
    if you are upgrading.  There are some changes in APIs that make the
    different versions incompatible.

3.  A new note for non-Sybase users: you will also have to comment out the
    sybdInitialize() function call in lsmain.c and test_obj.c to leave out
    the Sybase-CT objectsystem driver.  See below for more information.

4.  Users of newer GNU readline versions will need to add -lncurses or possibly
    -lcurses to the LIBS line in the Makefile; different versions of Readline
    evidently have different requirements regarding this.

5.  Developers, please read the CHANGELOG.  Thanks!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7.0, 13-Aug-2001

This is the initial public development release of the Centrallix Application
Server System.  You should be aware of a few things before trying to use this
version.

1.  This version should NOT be considered secure enough to run on a computer 
    that is accessible from the Internet.  It has not undergone a security 
    review yet.  Before running the Centrallix server on your system, please
    make sure that port 800 (Centrallix's default port) is not accessible
    on your machine from the Internet at large.  Furthermore, it does not yet
    employ SSL technology or other MD5 authentication for passwords; instead
    it uses standard HTTP basic authentication at present.  Don't risk sending
    your passwords in plain text over the Internet even via HTTP basic auth.

    On Linux, to block port 800, if eth0 is your network interface, do this:

        ipchains -I input -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 800 -j DENY

    Note, if you are behind a firewall, this additional step may or may not be
    necessary, depending on your trust level of your local LAN.  Furthermore,
    if you have run lokkit on RH7.1 and have secured your system so that port
    800 is not already accessible, you also may skip this step.

2.  This is a DEVELOPMENT release.  In fact it is the FIRST development
    release.  It may eat your hard drive.  It may eat every hard drive within
    a 100 mile radius.  Take care.

3.  This package has been successfully built and run on RedHat 6.2 on i386.
    I make no guarantees about other platforms and architectures....

4.  The default Makefile requires Sybase OpenClient to be installed on your
    machine.  Read the notes in the "centrallix" core package to see how to
    make it not dependent on Sybase OpenClient (you simply remove the Sybase
    CT-Lib ObjectSystem driver from the compile and omit the Sybase libraries
    in the $LIBS variable).  Or, you can download OpenClient for free from
    Sybase's website (the sybase-ocsd-10.0.4-6 RPM).

5.  To install the .TGZ files, most users should do the following (as root).
    Change the location of the .tgz files as appropriate for wherever you
    download them on your machine.

    # cd /usr/local
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-0.7.0.tgz
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-lib-0.7.0.tgz
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-os-0.7.0.tgz
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-doc-0.7.0.tgz
    # tar -xzvf /usr/local/archive/centrallix-sysdoc-0.7.0.tgz
    # less centrallix-os/INSTALL.txt
    # cp centrallix-os/doc/install/rootnode* /usr/local/etc
    # cp centrallix-os/doc/install/types.cfg /usr/local/etc
    # vi /usr/local/etc/rootnode

    Edit the rootnode file and change "/home/centrallix/os" to the location
    where you un-tarred the centrallix-os package.  In the above example,
    that would be "/usr/local/centrallix-os".  Now, make and run the 
    program itself.

    # cd centrallix-lib
    # make
    # cd ../centrallix
    # make
    # ./centrallix
