We also must point out that due to the content of the generated
DHTML output of this program (it contains extensive javascript
directly from the source of Centrallix itself), that output
MUST be considered a "work based on the program" in compliance
with the GNU General Public License, and is thus covered by that
license.  That output is already in "source" format when emitted
by Centrallix.  Copying, modification, redistribution, etc., of
that output (including DHTML, embedded javascript, etc.) is 
covered under the conditions of the GPL.

We are working on a solution to this issue so that your generated
DHTML output can be under a copyright and license of your own
choice.

Any normal .app file, however, you wholly create yourself is
obviously under your own copyright, and you may distribute (or
not distribute) such files in any manner you please.
