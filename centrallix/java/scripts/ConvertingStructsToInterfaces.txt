To convert a C struct to a Java interface, use the convert-struct.pl script.

Example: ./convert-struct.pl src/main/java org.lightsys.centrallix.objectsystem ../include/obj.h

To convert ALL C structs in many header files, run: ./convert-all.sh
The list of header files and the Java packages they belong to are listed in header-files.txt

There is a mapping between short struct names and their full names (e.g. _ET => Expression)
in the file struct-short-names.txt; this file is generated by get-struct-names.pl.
