Installing Centrallix

This document will describe how to install Centrallix on your system.  This
does not go in depth with installing database modules or other system
configuration issues.  The Centrallix install process can be broken down into
three sections outlined below.


1.  INSTALL REQUIRED PACKAGES
=============================

    It is recommended that you install all of the centrallix packages listed
    below.  They are each very useful, but only the ones marked with an
    asterisk (*) are required for the compilation of Centrallix.  You can
    download the latest releases of each of these packages from our
    SourceForge project page:
       http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=33299.  

    Packages:

      Req?  Package            Provides
    =======================================================================
    * YES   centrallix         Base Centrallix code

    * YES   centrallix-lib     Libraries necessary for the compliation of
                               the centrallix package.

    * YES   centrallix-os      The object system base directory.  This is 
                               similar to the concept of a DocumentRoot
                               in Apache.  This package provides required
                               images and sample application files for the
                               html generation subsystem.

      NO    centrallix-sysdoc  System architecture and design documentaion
                               for Centrallix.  This is a great place to
                               look if you are planning on coding for
                               Centrallix.

      NO    centrallix-doc     User documentation for using and creating
                               application and report generation files.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    You must first install the centrallix-lib and centrallix-os packages.
    These packages have their own INSTALL documents that describe the
    installation process individually.  Installing the centrallix package is
    described in the following steps.


2.  COMPILE AND INSTALL CENTRALLIX
==================================
    Since the last release of Centrallix, we have added autoconf support.
    This means that you can run the familiar "configure" script to detect
    settings on your system.  You can also specify the "--prefix" parameter
    to the configure script to tell where to install Centrallix.  Type
    "./configure --help" for a list of the available options.  The following
    example assumes you want to install to "/usr/local";

      $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
      $ make
      $ make install

    Make sure you have correctly installed the centrallix-lib package before
    attempting to compile this module.  It will not work.  You must also add
    the lib path that the centrallix-lib installed to in your
    /etc/ld.so.conf file.  This is all covered in the INSTALL document for
    centrallix-lib.

    If you have Sybase installed, the configure script should detect this
    and should set up and install the Centrallix Sybase object driver.  You
    should note this for the configuration step (step 3).

    Once this process is completed, you should have centrallix executable at
    the path /usr/local/sbin/centrallix.  If you do not, something has gone
    wrong with the build process.  Make sure that you have installed the
    packages that are required (see step 1).


3.  CONFIGURE CENTRALLIX
========================
    Now that you have successfully installed Centrallix, you will neet to
    make copies of the configuration scripts and customize them based on
    your installation environment.  The first thing to do is to copy the
    files located in [CVSROOT]/centrallix/etc to /usr/local/etc (assuming
    that you set the --prefix option to "/usr/local" in step 2).  This
    should copy three files:  centrallix.conf, rootnode, and types.cfg. 

    Load the centrallix.conf file in your favorite editor (you might need to
    set the tabstop to 8 characters to make it display correctly).  Be sure
    that the "types_config" points to the "types.cfg" file that we just
    copied, and the same with the "rootnode_file" option, make it point to
    the "rootnode" file we just copied.

    Under the net_http options, you can change the port number that
    Centrallix listens on.  If you are running Centrallix as a non-root user
    (recommended), you will need to change the port to something higher than
    1024 or you will get permission errors when running Centrallix.  The
    other options in here can be changed at your discression.

    WARNING:  We do not recommend allowing connections to the Centrallix
        server from an untrusted network (i.e. the Internet).  We have not
        done any serious security audit on the code.  You should either
        block the Centrallix port from the outside world by your firewall,
        or else run Centrallix completely internally on a computer that
        cannot be seen from the outside world.

    Under the mtsession options, it is recommended that you change the
    auth_method option to be "altpasswd" instead of "system".  This will
    allow you to specify a password file that is separate from your system
    password file.  You will also need to create this separate password
    file.  To do this, it is easiest to just use the "htpasswd" program that
    is most likely already installed on your system (it comes with most
    RedHat installations). If you do not have this program, the format for
    the file is simply username:crypt_password.  Below is an example of how
    to create a cxpasswd file using htpasswd.

      $ htpasswd -c cxpasswd luke       # Note that -c creates a new file
      New password:                     # and this is only done the first
      Re-type new password:             # time or else your cxpasswd file
      Adding password for user luke     # will be overwritten with the 
                                        # next username/password combination
      $ htpasswd cxpasswd guest         # created.
      New password: 
      Re-type new password: 
      Adding password for user guest

    Finally, you may need to comment out the sybd module listed under the
    "modules" section of the config file.  You will need to do this if you
    do not have the Sybase libraries installed on your system, and the build
    process in step 2 did not compile the Sybase module.  In most
    situations, this is the case unless you have specifically installed
    Sybase.


RUN CENTRALLIX
==============
    At this point, you have fully configured Centrallix and should be able
    to play with it.  To run it, simply execute /usr/local/sbin/centrallix.
    Depending on your setup, you may need to specify the path of the
    configuration file.  To do this, just execute with the following:

      $ /usr/local/sbin/centrallix -c /usr/local/etc/centrallix.conf
