OVERVIEW

    The table widget provides the capability to display tabular data on the web
    page, and will operate in one of three primary modes:  static, dynamicpage,
    and dynamicrow.  Here is the explanation of these three modes, from the
    widget driver file itself:

            Static means an inline table that can't be updated
            without a parent container being completely reloaded.
            DynamicPage means a table in a layer that can be
            reloaded dynamically as a whole when necessary.  Good
            when you need forward/back without reloading the page.
            DynamicRow means each row is its own layer.  Good when
            you need to insert rows dynamically and delete rows
            dynamically at the client side without reloading the
            whole table contents.
    
            A static table's query is performed on the server side
            and the HTML is generated at the server.  Both dynamic
            types are built from a client-side query.  Static
            tables are generally best when the data will be read-
            only.  Dynamicrow tables use the most client resources.
