OVERVIEW

    The ImageButton widget provides a clickable button that is comprised of a
    set of two or three images.  The first image is shown normally when the
    button is idle, the second when the button is pointed-to, and the third
    image is shown when the button is actually clicked.  This provides a "tri-
    state" appearance much like that provided by buttons in modern user
    interfaces, although the button can be two-state, with just an "unclicked"
    and "clicked" version of the image.

    The images are automatically swapped out when the appropriate mouse events
    occur on the button.
