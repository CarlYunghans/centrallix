<h3 class="overview">Overview:</h3>
<span class="overview">
			<p>The objectsource widget lies at the core of Centrallix's ability to dynamically exchange data between the server and client. This widget implements a form of &quot;replication&quot; by maintaining a replica of a small segment of data in the user agent.</p>
			<p>Both form and dynamic table widgets interact with the objectsource nonvisual widget to acquire data, update data, create data, and delete data. In fact, it is possible for more than one form and/or table to be connected with a given objectsource, to perform a variety of functions.</p>
			<p>Note: at the time of this writing, the objectsource widget was in its design phase and had not yet been implemented.</p>
		</span><h3 class="usage">Usage:</h3>
