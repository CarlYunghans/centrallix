<h3 class="overview">Overview:</h3>
<span class="overview">
			<p>The objectsource widget lies at the core of Centrallix's ability to dynamically exchange data between the server and client. This widget implements a form of &quot;replication&quot; by maintaining a replica of a small segment of data in the user agent.</p>
			<p>Both form and dynamic table widgets interact with the objectsource nonvisual widget to acquire data, update data, create data, and delete data. In fact, it is possible for more than one form and/or table to be connected with a given objectsource, to perform a variety of functions.</p>
			<p>ObjectSources offer synchronization with other objectsources via the Sync and DoubleSync actions (see below).  These actions allow the application to contain multiple objectsources with primary key / foreign key relationships, and to have those objectsources automatically stay in synchronization with each other based on those relationships.</p>
		</span><h3 class="usage">Usage:</h3>
<span class="usage">
			<p>Objectsource widgets are normally used at the top-level of an application, within a &quot;widget/page&quot; object, but can be used anywhere.  The forms/tables that use an objectsource are generally placed within that objectsource.  A page may have more than one objectsource widget.</p>
			<p>Even though the objectsource is nonvisual, it is, like the form widget, a container, and can (should!) contain other visual and nonvisual widgets.</p>

<td class="description">Performs a double synchronization with two other objectsources, known as the Parent and the Child, in two steps.  The first step is like Sync (see below), with a ParentOSRC and ParentKey[1-9]/ParentSelfKey[1-9].  Next, a Sync is performed between the current objectsource and the ChildOSRC in the same way the first step performed a sync between the ParentOSRC and the current objectsource, respectively, using SelfChildKey[1-9]/ChildKey[1-9].</td>

<tr>
<td class="name">Sync</td>
<td class="description">Performs a synchronization operation with another objectsource by re-running the query for this objectsource based on another objectsource's data.  Used for implementing relationships between objectsources.  The ParentOSRC (string) parameter specifies the name of the objectsource to sync with.  Up to nine synchronization keys can be specified, as ParentKey1 and ChildKey1 through ParentKey9 and ChildKey9.  The ParentKey indicates the name of the field in the ParentOSRC to sync with (probably a primary key), and ChildKey indicates the name of the field (the foreign key) in the current objectsource to match with the parent objectsource.</td>
