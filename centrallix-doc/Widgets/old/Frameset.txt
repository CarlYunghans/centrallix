OVERVIEW

    The frameset widget allows for the construction of a page using HTML frames
    so that multiple pages can be displayed simultaneously.  Frequently frames
    are frowned upon in the HTML community, but sometimes they can be of some
    value, so this widget is included here.

    Framesets can have one of two directions: either row-wise or column-wise.
    A "rows" frameset will have multiple frames stacked one on top of the other
    from the top of the page to the bottom.  A "columns" frameset will have 
    the frames stacked side by side from left to right.

    Frameset widgets also gather information from their subwidgets (normally
    either widget/page or widget/frameset) for information on how large to make
    each of the frames relative to one another.


STRUCTURE FILE PROPERTIES

    The following properties are valid for a widget of type "widget/frameset":

        direction	(string) Specifies whether this is a rows or a columns
			frameset.  This string value can either be "rows" or
			"columns".  See the overview, above, for the 
			difference.

	borderwidth	(integer) Specifies how thick the borders are that 
			separate the frames from one another.  The borderwidth
			can be zero.

    The following properties are valid for the sub-widgets of a frameset, and
    provide information for the widget/frameset that contains those widgets.
    If, for instance, one frameset is embedded inside another, these properties
    if they occur in the child frameset, provide information to the parent 
    frameset, not the child.

        framesize	(integer/string) Specifies the amount of space this
			element of the frameset will occupy.  Can either be an
			integer value in pixels, or a string value containing
			a percentage.  The latter would indicate the relative
			amount of space the individual frame should occupy.

	marginwidth	(integer) Specifies how wide the margins will be at the
			top, bottom, left, and right edges of the frame.  Can
			be zero.

EXAMPLE USAGE

    // Of course this example doesn't put any content into any of the frames,
    // but rather just illustrates the principle....  This creates three 
    // frames, two small ones side by side on top, and one large one on the
    // bottom of the screen.
    //
    BigFrameset "widget/frameset"
        {
	direction = rows
	borderwidth = 3

	TopFrameset "widget/frameset"
	    {
	    framesize = "40%"
	    direction = columns
	    borderwidth = 3

	    TopLeftDocument "widget/page"
	        {
		framesize = "50%"
		}

	    TopRightDocument "widget/page"
	        {
		framesize = "50%"
		}
	    }

	BottomDocument "widget/page"
	    {
	    framesize = "60%"
	    }
	}
