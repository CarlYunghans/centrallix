OVERVIEW

    The TabControl widget provides a DHTML tab control within Centrallix.  The
    widget behaves in the same way as tab controls in MS-Windows, X-Windows,
    and so forth, providing a set of tab pages, layered one on top of the 
    other, which can be selected (brought to the foreground) by clicking the
    mouse on the respective visible tab at the top of the tab control.

    To further distinguish which tab at the top of the tab control is active,
    this widget slightly modifies the X/Y position of the tab as well as 
    changing a thumbnail image (on the left edge of the tab) to further enhance
    the distinction between selected and inactive tab pages.

    The tab pages are containers, and as such, controls of various kinds, 
    including other tab controls, can be placed inside the tab pages.

    Tab pages are added to a tab control by including widgets of type
    "widget/tabpage" within the "widget/tab" widget in the structure file that
    defines the application.  Any controls to appear inside a particular tab
    page should be placed inside their respective "widget/tabpage" widgets in
    the structure file.


STRUCTURE FILE PROPERTIES

    The following properties are valid for a widget of type "widget/tab":

        x		Specifies the left edge of the tab control relative
			to its container, in pixels.

	y		Specifies the top edge of the tab control relative
			to its container, in pixels.

	width		Specifies the width, in pixels, of the tab control.

	height		Specifies the height, in pixels, of the tab control.
			Height should include both the body of the tab
			control as well as the space used by the tabs at the
			top.

	selected	(string) Specifies which tab is initially selected.
			If not specified, the first tab will be initially
			selected.

	bgcolor		(string) specifies the background color of the tab
			control, tabs, and tab pages.

	background	(string) specifies an image to be used as the
			background of the tab control.  If neither bgcolor or
			background are specified, the tab control is trans-
			parent.

	textcolor	(string) specifies the color of the text to be used on
			the tabs.  Defaults to black.

    The following properties are valid for a widget of type "widget/tabpage":

        title		(string) specifies the text to be printed on the tab
			that goes with this tabpage.  Otherwise the name of
			the tabpage (from the structure file) is used.
