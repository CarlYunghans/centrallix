OVERVIEW

    The scrollpane widget provides a container and a scrollbar.  The scrollbar
    can be used to move up and down in the container, so more content can be
    placed in the container than can be normally viewed at one time.

    The scrollbar includes a draggable thumb as well as up and down arrows at
    the top and bottom.  Clicking the arrows scrolls the content of the 
    container up or down by a small amount, whereas clicking on the scrollbar
    itself above or below the thumb will scroll the area by a large amount.
