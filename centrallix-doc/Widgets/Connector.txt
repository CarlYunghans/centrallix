OVERVIEW

    Each widget can have events and actions associated with it.  The events 
    occur when certain things occur via the user interface, via timers, or even
    as a result of data being loaded from the server.  Actions cause certain
    things to happen to or within a certain widget, for example causing an HTML
    layer to reload with a new page, or causing a scrollable area to scroll up
    or down.

    The connector widget allows an event to be linked with an action without 
    actually writing any JavaScript code to do so -- the connector object is 
    created, and given an event to trigger it and an action to perform when it
    is triggered.

    Events and actions can have parameters, which specify more information 
    about the occurrence of an event, or which specify more information about
    how to perform the action.  Such parameters from events can be linked into
    parameters for actions via the connector widget as well.

    The connector object should be a sub-object of the widget which will 
    trigger the event.

    An example connector would link the click of a URL in a treeview with the
    loading of a new page in an HTML area.  See the Example source code at the
    end of this document to see how this is done.


STRUCTURE FILE PROPERTIES

    The following properties are valid for a widget of type "widget/connector":

        event		(string) This is which event in the parent widget
			object will trigger the connector.

	target		(string) The name of the widget in which the action 
			will occur.
	
	action		(string) The name of the action to take place within
			the target widget.

    In addition, properties can be listed whose name is the name of a parameter
    for the action, and whose string value is the name of a parameter for the
    event.


EVENTS

    A connector has no events.


ACTIONS

    A connector has no actions.


EXAMPLE USAGE

    MyPage "widget/page"
        {
	// The treeview, with a list of clickable items.
	tv1 "widget/treeview"
	    {
	    x = 0
	    y = 0
	    width = 200
	    height = 100
	    source = "/"

	    // Here's our connector
	    cn1 "widget/connector"
	        {
		// Triggered by ClickItem from the treeview.
		event = ClickItem

		// Causes the LoadPage action on html area 'ht1'
		target = ht1
		action = LoadPage

		// The Source for LoadPage is the Pathname from ClickItem.
		Source = Pathname
		}
	    }

	// The HTML area, viewing the selected document.
	ht1 "widget/html"
	    {
	    x = 0
	    y = 110
	    width = 200
	    height = 100
	    mode = dynamic
	    }
	}
