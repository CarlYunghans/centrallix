<h2>FORM</h2>
<h3>Overview...</h3>
<p>The form widget is used as a high-level container for form elements.=  Essentially, a form widget represents a single record of data, or the attributes of a single object in the objectsystem (or of a single query result set object). Form widgets must be used in conjunction with an ObjectSource widget, which does the actual transferring of data to and from the server.</p>
<p>Forms have five different &quot;modes&quot;of operation, each of which can be specifically allowed or disallowed for the form.</p>
<ol>
<li> No Data - form inactive/disabled, no data viewed/edited.</li>
<li> View - data being viewed readonly.</li>
<li> Modify - existing data being modified.</li>
<li> Query - query criteria being entered (used for query-by-form applications)</li>
<li> New - new object being entered/created.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: at the time of this writing, the form widget was in its design phase and had not yet been implemented.</p>
<h3>Usage...</h3>
<p>Although the form widget itself is nonvisual in nature, it can contain visual widgets, including other containers, which may then in turn contain form elements as well.=  The form widget may be contained within any widget with a visual container (otherwise, the form elements would not show up on the page).</p>
