<h3 class="overview">Overview:</h3>
<span class="overview">
			<p>The form provides a way to display query results in a non-tabular fashion.  Each individual piece of data has to be manually positioned, requiring more effort but giving more flexibility.  The form will essentially iterate through its contents for each record it retrieves from a query.</p>
			<p>Forms can have one of three modes: normal, outer, and inner.  A 'normal' form simply starts the query, retrieves all of the results from the query (up to the reclimit maximum), iterating over its content once for each record, and then ends the query, discarding any data remaining.  An 'outer' form starts the query and then iterates over its content while more results are available, but does not actually retrieve the results itself.  An 'inner' form works only (directly or indirectly) inside an 'outer' form, and retrieves records (up to the reclimit maximum) but does not start or end the query.</p>
			<p>The typical reason to use 'outer' and 'inner' mode forms is to group query results in chunks of a certain size, perhaps in a part of a multipage preprinted form such as a receipt or invoice.  The 'outer' mode form is used to surround the multipage preprinted forms as a whole, and the 'inner' mode form is used to generate the section of the report that contains the list that carries over from page to page but in an area not the size of the entire form (and possibly having other data above and/or below it).</p>
			<p>Forms can also be used with multiple queries simultaneously.  They support running these queries in one of several fashions: 'nested', 'parallel', and 'multinested'.  In the first, 'nested', if two queries were specified, the second query would be run once in its entirety for each record returned from the first - this is identical to nesting multiple forms inside of one another, each referencing only one query.</p>
			    <table>
				<tr>
<th>1,2,3</th>
<th>a,b</th>
</tr>
				<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>a</td>
</tr>
				<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>b</td>
</tr>
				<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>a</td>
</tr>
				<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>b</td>
</tr>
				<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>a</td>
</tr>
				<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>b</td>
</tr>
			    </table>
			<p>The second, 'parallel', runs the queries simultaneously and independently of one another - the results are combined together on the output - and continues until no query has more records.</p>
			    <table>
				<tr>
<th>1,2,3</th>
<th>a,b</th>
</tr>
				<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>a</td>
</tr>
				<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>b</td>
</tr>
				<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>NULL</td>
</tr>
			    </table>
			<p>The third, 'multinested', is more interesting - here the form iterates once through each query before the nested queries are run, giving each individual record its own unique line.</p>
