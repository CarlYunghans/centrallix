<h1>Centrallix<br>Reporting System<br>Reference</h1>
<br><p>The Centrallix reporting system provides the ability to generate reports in a variety of formats from ObjectSystem data and a report object.  This document describes the report object structure in detail and how to use the various report components to build a report.</p>
<p>Sample code is generally given in &quot;structure file&quot; format, which is the normal format for the building of applications.  However, other suitable object-structured data formats can be used, including XML.</p>
