Place the centrallix.lang file in the following directory (in linux)

/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs

You may need to change permissions on this folder.

This file is for gedit, and it is very easy to 
add new keywords and function names.

To use this language file as a syntax highlighter,
open a *.cmp in gedit, then go to

View -> Highlight Mode -> Source -> Centrallix
