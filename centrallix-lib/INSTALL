Installing Centrallix-lib

This document will describe how to compile and install the Centrallix libraries
on your system.  This doesn't go into too much depth with troubleshooting, but
if you have problems, please subscribe to our mailing lists for help.  The
build and install process for the libs is very easy.


COMPILE LIBS
============
    Compilation is simple for the libs.  All you need to do is run the
    configure script and then do make and make install as shown in the example
    below.  You can set the --prefix option to anywhere you desire.  This
    should be the same as the prefix for the centrallix package.

      $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
      $ make
      $ make install

    This will create the files libCentrallix.a and libCentrallix.so in
    /usr/local/lib (assuming you use the --prefix=/usr/local option, otherwise
    add your own prefix there).  Be sure that the previously mentioned path is
    listed in /etc/ld.so.conf and be sure to run ldconfig.

    If you install into /usr/local, you must be root.

    If you install into your home directory (as non-root), you must set your
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly (instead of /etc/ld.so.conf).


TEST SUITE
==========
    If you want to run the centrallix-lib test suite, type "make test" at the
    prompt (from within the centrallix-lib main directory):

      $ make test

    If you are using Valgrind, you can also run the test suite under Valgrind
    by configuring centrallix-lib for Valgrind support and then running the
    Valgrind-enabled version of the test suite:

      $ make valtest

    The test suite should be run on a system 1GHz or faster; otherwise the
    test suite may falsely report 'lockups' (the test suite lockup-detection
    timer in t_driver.c can be modified to wait longer than 10 seconds if the
    suite must be run on a slow machine).

    If you only need to run a subset of the test suite, set the environment
    variable $TONLY to the appropriate component, such as:

      $ export TONLY=qprintf
      $ make test

    Benchmarks of known results are provided in the test suite directory for
    comparison purposes.

    All test suite items should 'PASS', except for some of the BASELINE items
    which intentionally will fail in various ways to make sure test failure
    detection is working.  Those items are marked appropriately.  The assert()
    failure message goes along with the ABORT result for the corresponding
    test suite item.

    [ ** Note:  we're aware that the 'smmalloc' module is not passing its test
    suite.  That module is not currently used by Centrallix, however. ]


COMPILE CENTRALLIX
==================
    The next step is to compile the centrallix package.  For instructions on
    that, see the INSTALL document associated with that package.
