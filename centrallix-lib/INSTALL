Installing Centrallix-lib

This document will describe how to compile and install the Centrallix libraries
on your system.  This doesn't go into too much depth with troubleshooting, but
if you have problems, please subscribe to our mailing lists for help.  The
build and install process for the libs is very easy.


COMPILE LIBS
============
    Compilation is simple for the libs.  All you need to do is run the
    configure script and then do make and make install as shown in the example
    below.  You can set the --prefix option to anywhere you desire.  This
    should be the same as the prefix for the centrallix package.

      $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
      $ make
      $ make install

    This will create the files libCentrallix.a and libCentrallix.so in
    /usr/local/lib (assuming you use the --prefix=/usr/local option, otherwise
    add your own prefix there).  Be sure that the previously mentioned path is
    listed in /etc/ld.so.conf and be sure to run ldconfig.


COMPILE CENTRALLIX
==================
    The next step is to compile the centrallix package.  For instructions on
    that, see the INSTALL document associated with that package.
