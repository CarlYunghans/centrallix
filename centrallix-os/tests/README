The Centrallix Test Application Suite is designed to be used as a test of
functionality to make sure that the htmlgen subsystem is working properly.
These test applications make use of a large percentage of the available
functionality in the htlmgen subsystem.  Some applications are also designed to
be torture tests to test its limits.  It is intended to be used as a tool to
help htmlgen developers verify that their changes work properly and that they
have not messed up other parts of the system as well.
