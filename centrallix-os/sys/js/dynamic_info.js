note: this file is never actually used anywhere. It was created so

dynamically generated global js variables (see README). No place would
otherwise exist.

documentation for cx__capabilities is located in ht_render.c
(centrallix/htmlgen/ht_render.c) where it is actually implemented.

documentation for pg_* variables is in htdrv_page.c
