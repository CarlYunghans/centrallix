The Centrallix ObjectSystem
----------------------------

This is a filesystem-based objectsystem.  Included in this directory
are the Centrallix bootstrap configuration files.  They normally
live in /usr/local/etc - put them there and the default install of
Centrallix should hum along just fine.  What follows is a quick
explanation of what these three critical files do.

rootnode:

    The "rootnode" file contains data which would normally be a node
    object in Centrallix itself.  The rootnode is handled by a special
    objectsystem driver that is builtin to the OSML.  Normally the 
    rootnode is based in the filesystem, and so the UXD filesystem
    driver is invoked for the root of the objectsystem.  This is the
    default - make sure the path in "rootnode" points to the correct
    location for the objectsystem, normally /var/centrallix/os on RH7
    systems or /home/centrallix/os on RH6 systems.

    Don't understand all of this jibber-jabber about node objects and
    rootnodes?  Don't worry - just make sure the path is correct in
    the rootnode file and install the rootnode file in /usr/local/etc.


rootnode.type:

    Since the filename for "rootnode" must be predictable, the OSML will
    not be able to determine its type automatically (or else the type of
    the rootnode would end up being hardcoded into the OSML startup code).
    Thus, the OSML rootnode pseudo-driver is instructed to read the type
    from this file.  The type should be one of those listed in types.cfg.


types.cfg:

    Centrallix has a hierarchical object and content type database,
    which exists as /usr/local/etc/types.cfg normally.  This file must be
    in a predictable location for Centrallix.
