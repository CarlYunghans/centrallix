    <center><img src=/sys/images/blue_gradient.png height=2 width=200></center>
    <br>
    1. This is a development release!  Lots of things are still
	    broken (if you hadn't noticed)! :)<p>
    2. Centrallix 0.9.0 has full support for Mozilla/Firefox, but
	    only partial support for Internet Explorer.  The legacy
	    support for Netscape 4.x is now officially deprecated.<p>
