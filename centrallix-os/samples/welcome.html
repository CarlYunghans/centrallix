    If you need additional help in configuring or using
    your new Centrallix setup, there are several places
    that you can go:
    <ul>
	<li><b>Centrallix-users Mailing List:</b> We 
	    have a mailing list
	    specifically for Centrallix users.  To 
	    subscribe, see the www.centrallix.net 
	    website.
	<li><b>Documentation Packages:</b> If you didn't
	    install them, install the centrallix-doc
	    package for more information about application
	    development, and the centrallix-sysdoc package
	    if you are a C/JavaScript coder and want to
	    help on Centrallix itself.
    </ul>
